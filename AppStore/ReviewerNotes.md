   - Enter any service name (e.g., "Netflix", "Spotify")
   - Set a trial end date (recommend setting it 2-3 days from today for testing)
   - Add optional details like price ($9.99) and billing cycle (Monthly)
   - Tap "Save"

3. **View subscription details:**
   - Tap any subscription in the list
   - See countdown to trial end date
   - View all subscription information
   - Test the "Mark as Cancelled" button

4. **Test notifications:**
   - Go to Settings tab
   - Enable "Notifications"
   - Grant notification permissions when prompted
   - The app will schedule alerts before trials end

5. **Test savings tracker:**
   - Cancel a subscription (mark as cancelled)
   - Go to the "Savings" tab
   - See tracked savings from cancelled trials

6. **Test free tier limit:**
   - Add 5 subscriptions
   - Try to add a 6th subscription
   - A prompt will appear showing subscription limit reached
   - This demonstrates the free tier functionality

## Third-Party Services

### 1. DeepSeek AI API
**Purpose:** AI-powered receipt/email scanning to extract subscription details  
**Usage:** Optional feature - users can manually enter subscriptions or use AI scanning  
**Implementation:** 
- API endpoint: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions`
- Used only when user explicitly scans a receipt/email
- No data stored on DeepSeek servers
- API key included in app bundle (required for testing)

**To test AI scanning:**
- Tap "Scan Receipt" when adding a subscription
- Take a photo of any receipt or subscription email
- The AI will attempt to extract service name, price, and billing date
- User can edit/confirm before saving

### 2. Supabase (Backend & Authentication)
**Purpose:** Optional user authentication and cloud sync  
**Usage:** Users can optionally sign in to sync data across devices  
**Implementation:**
- Supabase project URL: `https://tyxcmzpuhwkuuqnwamwj.supabase.co`
- Authentication: Google OAuth Sign-In
- Database: PostgreSQL for storing user subscriptions
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled - users only see their own data

**To test authentication (optional):**
- Go to Settings tab
- Tap "Sign In" (or "Account")
- Choose "Sign in with Google"
- Use any Google account
- Data will sync to Supabase backend

**Note:** Authentication is **completely optional** - the app works fully without signing in.
