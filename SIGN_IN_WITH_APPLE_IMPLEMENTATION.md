# Sign in with Apple Implementation Guide

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED  
**App**: Kansyl - Free Trial Reminder

---

## Overview

Sign in with Apple is now fully implemented in Kansyl. This document describes the implementation, how to test it, and what to configure in the Apple Developer Portal.

---

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Entitlement Enabled
**File**: `kansyl/kansyl.entitlements`

The Sign in with Apple entitlement has been uncommented:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.applesignin</key>
<array>
    <string>Default</string>
</array>
```

### 2. ‚úÖ AppleSignInCoordinator Created
**File**: `kansyl/Helpers/AppleSignInCoordinator.swift`

A new coordinator class handles the entire Apple Sign In flow:

**Features**:
- Generates cryptographically secure nonce for security
- Creates SHA256 hash of nonce
- Handles `ASAuthorizationController` delegate callbacks
- Provides presentation context for the authorization UI
- Extracts identity token and user information
- Handles user cancellation gracefully

**Key Methods**:
- `signIn()` - Starts the Apple Sign In flow
- `generateNonce()` - Creates secure random nonce
- `sha256()` - Hashes the nonce for Apple's requirements

### 3. ‚úÖ SupabaseAuthManager Updated
**File**: `kansyl/Managers/SupabaseAuthManager.swift`

Enhanced the `signInWithApple()` method to:

**Features**:
- Accept `PersonNameComponents` for full name
- Handle anonymous mode migration (just like Google & Email auth)
- Create or load user profile
- Update SubscriptionStore with new user ID
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

**Anonymous Mode Migration**:
```swift
// Check if user was in anonymous mode BEFORE updating anything
let wasInAnonymousMode = UserStateManager.shared.isAnonymousMode
let anonymousUserID = UserStateManager.shared.getAnonymousUserID()

// Migrate anonymous data if user was anonymous
if wasInAnonymousMode {
    try await UserStateManager.shared.migrateAnonymousDataToAccount(
        viewContext: PersistenceController.shared.container.viewContext,
        newUserID: response.user.id.uuidString
    )
}
```

### 4. ‚úÖ LoginView Updated
**File**: `kansyl/Views/Auth/LoginView.swift`

Replaced the placeholder Apple Sign In button with real implementation:

**Changes**:
- Added `@StateObject private var appleSignInCoordinator`
- Updated `handleAppleSignIn()` to use the real coordinator
- Handles cancellation gracefully (no error shown)
- Passes full name to auth manager for profile creation

## How Apple Sign In Works

### Flow Diagram

```
User taps "Continue with Apple"
        ‚Üì
LoginView.handleAppleSignIn() called
        ‚Üì
AppleSignInCoordinator.signIn() initiates flow
        ‚Üì
Apple's authentication UI appears
        ‚Üì
User authenticates with Face ID / Touch ID / Password
        ‚Üì
Apple returns identity token + nonce + user info
        ‚Üì
AppleSignInCoordinator validates and returns result
        ‚Üì
SupabaseAuthManager.signInWithApple() processes token
        ‚Üì
Check if user was in anonymous mode
        ‚Üì
If yes: Migrate anonymous subscriptions to new account
        ‚Üì
Update SubscriptionStore with new user ID
        ‚Üì
Create or load user profile
        ‚Üì
User is authenticated and enters app
```

### Security Features

1. **Nonce Generation**: 
   - Cryptographically secure random string (32 characters)
   - Uses `SecRandomCopyBytes` for true randomness
   - Prevents replay attacks

2. **Nonce Hashing**: 
   - SHA256 hash sent to Apple
   - Original nonce used to verify response
   - Ensures authenticity of Apple's response

3. **Token Validation**: 
   - Identity token is JWT signed by Apple
   - Supabase validates the token server-side
   - Prevents tampering

## Testing Sign in with Apple

### Test on Real Device (Recommended)

1. **Build and run on a physical device**:
   ```bash
   # Connect your iPhone
   # Select your device in Xcode
   # Press Cmd+R to build and run
   ```

2. **Sign out of your Apple ID in Settings**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Apple ID ‚Üí Sign Out
   - This allows you to test the full sign-in flow

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Open Kansyl
   - Tap "Continue with Apple"
   - Sign in with your Apple ID
   - Authorize the app
   - Verify you're logged in successfully

4. **Test anonymous mode migration**:
   - Delete the app
   - Reinstall
   - Tap "Continue Without Account"
   - Add a subscription
   - Sign out (if signed in)
   - Tap "Continue with Apple"
   - Verify subscription was migrated to your account

### Test on Simulator (Limited)

**Note**: Sign in with Apple on simulator has limitations:
- Must be signed into an Apple ID in Simulator settings
- May not work on all simulator versions
- Real device testing is strongly recommended

1. **Use iOS 15+ simulator**
2. **Sign in to iCloud**:
   - Open Settings app in simulator
   - Tap "Sign in to your iPhone"
   - Enter your Apple ID
3. **Test the app**:
   - Run Kansyl
   - Tap "Continue with Apple"
   - Follow the flow

### What to Test

- [ ] **First-time user**: New account creation works
- [ ] **Returning user**: Existing account sign-in works
- [ ] **User cancellation**: Cancelling doesn't show error
- [ ] **Anonymous migration**: Subscriptions migrate when signing in from anonymous mode
- [ ] **Email retrieval**: Email is captured on first sign-in
- [ ] **Name retrieval**: Full name is captured on first sign-in (only on first auth)
- [ ] **Error handling**: Network errors show appropriate messages
- [ ] **UI responsiveness**: Button states update correctly
- [ ] **Session persistence**: User stays logged in after app restart

## Debugging Tips

### Enable Verbose Logging

All key operations are logged with emoji prefixes:

- üçé = Apple Sign In coordinator
- üîê = Security (nonce generation)
- üìù = Authorization request
- üöÄ = Flow start
- ‚úÖ = Success
- ‚ùå = Error
- ‚ö†Ô∏è = Warning (e.g., cancellation)

### View Logs in Xcode

1. Run the app from Xcode
2. Open the Debug Console (Cmd+Shift+Y)
3. Filter logs by searching for emoji: `üçé`

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Sign in with Apple failed: The operation couldn't be completed"

**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're signed into iCloud on the device/simulator
- Verify the entitlement is enabled
- Check provisioning profile is up to date

#### Issue: "Missing identity token"

**Solution**:
- This is an Apple-side issue
- Try signing out and back in to iCloud
- Restart the device

#### Issue: Button does nothing when tapped

**Solution**:
- Check Xcode console for error logs
- Verify entitlement is in `kansyl.entitlements`
- Ensure capability is in Xcode project
- Clean build folder and rebuild

#### Issue: "Unable to find presentation context"

**Solution**:
- This should be handled by `AppleSignInCoordinator`
- Check that the app has an active window
- Verify you're not presenting from a dismissed view

## Privacy & User Experience

### What Data is Collected

When a user signs in with Apple, Kansyl receives:

1. **Always provided**:
   - Unique user ID (opaque identifier from Apple)
   - Identity token (for Supabase authentication)

2. **Provided on first sign-in only**:
   - Email address (may be private relay email: `random@privaterelay.appleid.com`)
   - Full name (if user approves sharing)

3. **Never provided**:
   - Password (handled by Apple)
   - Birthday, payment info, or other personal data

### User Privacy Options

Apple allows users to:
- **Hide email**: Use a private relay email (e.g., `abc123@privaterelay.appleid.com`)
- **Share email**: Use their real email address
- **Share name**: Provide their full name to the app
- **Hide name**: Don't share their name

**Important**: Email and name are only provided on the **first authentication**. Subsequent sign-ins don't include this data.

### Supabase Integration

Supabase handles:
- Validating the identity token from Apple
- Creating or retrieving the user account
- Managing the session
- Storing user metadata
