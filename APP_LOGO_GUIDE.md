## üì± Icon Guidelines

### Apple's Requirements
- **Sizes**: Must include all required sizes (see generated files)
- **Format**: PNG, no transparency for App Store icon
- **Colors**: Use high contrast, test in light/dark mode
- **Simplicity**: Avoid text when possible, focus on single concept
- **Consistency**: Match your app's visual style

### Design Best Practices
1. **Focus on one element**: Clock OR Calendar OR Bell
2. **Use bold colors**: Stand out on home screen
3. **Test at small sizes**: Must be recognizable at 60x60
4. **Avoid gradients in icons smaller than 60px**
5. **Consider accessibility**: High contrast for visibility

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Use Professional Clock Icon (Recommended)
```bash
# Already generated - this is your current icon
# Located in: kansyl/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
```

### Switch to Calendar Variant
```bash
# Copy calendar variant to main icon folder
cp -r kansyl/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon-Calendar.appiconset/* \
      kansyl/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/
```

### Generate New Variants
```bash
# Clock/time theme (current)
python3 Scripts/generate_professional_icon.py

# Calendar theme
python3 Scripts/generate_calendar_icon.py

# Original simple design
python3 Scripts/generate_icon_simple.py
```

## üéØ Recommended Approach

For a professional app ready for the App Store:

1. **Start with generated icons**: Use the clock or calendar theme already created
2. **Test on device**: Build and run to see how it looks on actual iPhone
3. **Iterate if needed**: Adjust colors or elements based on visibility
4. **Consider hiring a designer**: For final App Store version, consider professional design
