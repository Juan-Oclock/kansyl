# Swipe Gesture Troubleshooting Guide 🔧

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Removed Button Wrapper Conflict**
- **Issue**: The `Button` wrapper was blocking drag gestures
- **Fix**: Replaced `Button` with `onTapGesture` to handle taps separately from swipes

### 2. **ScrollView Interference**
- **Issue**: Vertical ScrollView was capturing horizontal swipes
- **Fix**: Explicitly set ScrollView to `.vertical` only
- **Fix**: Used proper gesture modifiers to prioritize swipe

### 3. **Gesture Detection**
- **Issue**: Swipe wasn't being recognized
- **Fix**: Set minimum distance to 10 pixels
- **Fix**: Added interactive spring animations for immediate feedback

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### How to Test Swipe Actions:

1. **Launch the App**
   - Open the app in simulator or device
   - Navigate to the Subscriptions page

2. **Add Test Subscriptions** (if needed)
   - Tap the "+" button
   - Add a few test subscriptions

3. **Test the Swipe**
   - Place your finger on a subscription card
   - Swipe LEFT (towards the left edge)
   - Swipe at least 80 pixels to reveal actions
   - You should see:
     - Price fading out as you swipe
     - Two buttons appearing: "Keep" (purple) and "Cancel" (green)
     - Feel haptic feedback when actions appear

4. **Test Action Buttons**
   - Tap "Cancel" to mark as canceled
   - Tap "Keep" to mark as kept
   - Card should smoothly animate back to position

## 🐛 If Swipe Still Doesn't Work

### Quick Fixes:

1. **Clean Build**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/juan_oclock/Documents/ios-mobile/kansyl
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/kansyl-*
   xcodebuild clean
   xcodebuild build
   ```

2. **Restart Simulator**
   - Quit iOS Simulator completely
   - Relaunch from Xcode

3. **Check Gesture Settings**
   - In Simulator: Device > Restart
   - Ensure touch/drag is enabled

### Debug Mode:

If you need to debug, the code includes a `debugSwipeValue` variable that tracks swipe distance. You can add this overlay to see the value:

```swift
// Add to SubscriptionRowCard body, after the ZStack:
.overlay(
    Text("Swipe: \(Int(debugSwipeValue))")
        .font(.caption)
        .padding(4)
        .background(Color.black.opacity(0.7))
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .cornerRadius(4)
        .opacity(isDragging ? 1 : 0)
    , alignment: .topTrailing
)
```

## 📱 Gesture Behavior

### Expected Behavior:
- **Swipe Left**: Reveals action buttons
- **Swipe Right**: Closes action buttons (if open)
- **Tap**: Opens subscription details (only when not swiping)

### Thresholds:
- **Minimum swipe**: 10 pixels to start
- **Action trigger**: 80 pixels left
- **Maximum swipe**: 180 pixels (with elastic resistance)
- **Snap point**: 160 pixels when open

## 🎯 Visual Indicators

When working correctly, you should see:
1. **Smooth card movement** following your finger
2. **Price text fading** as buttons appear
3. **Button scale animation** as they reveal
4. **Haptic feedback** at 80px threshold
5. **Spring animation** when releasing

## 💡 Alternative Gesture Implementation

If the current implementation still has issues, here's an alternative approach using a dedicated swipe view modifier:

```swift
struct SwipeActions: ViewModifier {
    @Binding var offset: CGSize
    let onDelete: () -> Void
    let onKeep: () -> Void
    
    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content
            .offset(x: offset.width)
            .simultaneousGesture(
                DragGesture()
                    .onChanged { /* handle */ }
                    .onEnded { /* handle */ }
            )
    }
}
```

## 🔄 Current Implementation Status

✅ **Implemented**:
- Gesture recognition with DragGesture
- Smooth animations with Design.Animation
- Progressive fade effects
- Haptic feedback
- Action button functionality
- Design system integration

⚠️ **Known Limitations**:
- Swipe may conflict with ScrollView on some iOS versions
- Gesture might need fine-tuning for different device sizes

## 📞 Support

If issues persist:
1. Check iOS version compatibility (iOS 15+)
2. Verify no other gesture modifiers are conflicting
3. Ensure Core Data is properly connected
4. Check console for any runtime errors
