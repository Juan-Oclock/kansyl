## üîç Comparison: Your Landing Page vs. Comprehensive Version

### **Your Current Privacy Policy**

**Strengths:**
‚úÖ Clean, simple, easy to read  
‚úÖ Covers core concepts  
‚úÖ Emphasizes privacy-first approach  
‚úÖ Mentions local storage and iCloud  
‚úÖ Good for initial understanding  

**What's Missing for App Store:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Supabase Backend** - Your current policy says "no third-party servers" but you use Supabase for auth & sync  
‚ö†Ô∏è **DeepSeek AI Service** - No mention of AI receipt scanning data flow  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Email Collection** - Says "no personal identification" but you collect email via Google Sign-In  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Google OAuth** - Not mentioned as authentication provider  
‚ö†Ô∏è **GDPR/CCPA Rights** - Missing user rights sections (required for EU/CA users)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Retention Policy** - No specific timeline mentioned  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Third-Party Service Details** - Missing privacy policy links  

### **Your Current Terms of Service**

**Strengths:**
‚úÖ Covers basic terms  
‚úÖ Mentions subscriptions and payments  
‚úÖ Standard disclaimers present  

**What's Missing for App Store:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **AI Feature Terms** - No specific terms for receipt scanning  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Account Management** - Missing account creation/deletion terms  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Data Ownership** - Not clearly stated  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Apple-Specific Terms** - Missing Apple as third-party beneficiary clause  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Fair Use Policy** - No AI usage limits mentioned

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issue: Mismatch with Actual Implementation

### **Your Landing Page Says:**
> "All your data is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework."
> "No third-party servers are involved in storing your information"

### **But Your App Actually:**
- ‚úÖ Uses **Supabase** for backend authentication and data sync
- ‚úÖ Sends receipt text to **DeepSeek AI** for analysis
- ‚úÖ Collects **email addresses** via Google Sign-In
- ‚úÖ Stores data in **Supabase cloud database** (not just locally)

**This discrepancy could cause App Store rejection!**
