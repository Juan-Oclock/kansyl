# Subscription Type Conditions & Auto-Detection

## Overview
Subscription types are automatically determined and updated based on various conditions. The app supports three subscription types: **Trial**, **Paid**, and **Promotional**.

## Type Determination Logic (Priority Order)

The system checks in this exact order (first match wins):

### Priority 1: Name Keywords (Highest Priority)
- Contains "promo", "promotional", or "discount" â†’ **Promotional** ðŸŸ£
- Contains "trial" or "free" â†’ **Trial** ðŸŸ 

### Priority 2: Notes Keywords
- Contains "promo", "promotional", or "discount" â†’ **Promotional** ðŸŸ£
- Contains "trial" or "free" â†’ **Trial** ðŸŸ 

### Priority 3: Legacy isTrial Flag
- If `isTrial` = true AND no promo keywords â†’ **Trial** ðŸŸ 

### Priority 4: Duration & Price
- 0-30 days with price > $0 â†’ **Paid** ðŸŸ¢
- 0-30 days with price = $0 â†’ **Trial** ðŸŸ 
- 31-90 days with price = $0 â†’ **Trial** ðŸŸ 
- 31-90 days with price > $0 â†’ **Paid** ðŸŸ¢
- 91+ days â†’ **Paid** ðŸŸ¢

### Priority 5: Price Only
- Price = $0 â†’ **Trial** ðŸŸ 
- Price > $0 â†’ **Paid** ðŸŸ¢

### 3. ðŸŸ¢ **Paid Subscriptions**
A subscription is classified as "Paid" when:
1. **Duration â‰¤ 30 days with price > $0** (monthly subscriptions)
2. **Duration 31-90 days with price > $0** (quarterly subscriptions)
3. **Duration 91-365 days** (annual subscriptions)
4. **Duration > 365 days** (long-term subscriptions)
5. **Has a price > $0** and doesn't match trial/promo conditions

## Auto-Update Scenarios

The subscription type is automatically recalculated in these situations:

### 1. **When Creating a New Subscription**
- Type is determined based on the name, notes, duration, and price
- User entering "Netflix Trial" â†’ automatically marked as Trial
- User entering "Spotify Promo" â†’ automatically marked as Promotional

### 2. **When Editing an Existing Subscription**
- Type is recalculated when user saves changes
- If user changes name from "Netflix" to "Netflix Trial" â†’ updates to Trial
- If user adds "50% discount" to notes â†’ updates to Promotional
- If user changes price from $0 to $9.99 â†’ updates from Trial to Paid

### 3. **During Initial Migration**
- All existing subscriptions are analyzed on first app launch
- Types are assigned based on current values

### 4. **Manual Conversion**
- When converting trial to paid via the TrialConversionView
- Type changes from Trial to Paid automatically
