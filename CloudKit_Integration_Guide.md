2. **Core Data Model Updates** (`Kansyl.xcdatamodel`)
   - Added CloudKit configurations
   - Split data into CloudKit (synced) and Local (non-synced) configurations
   - Subscription data syncs, ServiceTemplate data remains local

3. **Core Data Stack** (`Persistence.swift`)
   - Upgraded to `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`
   - Configured dual-store setup (CloudKit + Local)
   - Added remote change notification support

4. **CloudKit Manager** (`CloudKitManager.swift`)
   - Account status monitoring
   - Premium user validation
   - Sync enable/disable functionality
   - Manual sync operations
   - Error handling integration

5. **Error Handling** (`CloudKitErrorHandler.swift`)
   - Comprehensive CloudKit error mapping
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Recovery action suggestions
   - Automatic retry logic

6. **UI Integration**
   - Updated `UserProfileView` with functional iCloud controls
   - Enhanced `EnhancedSettingsView` with sync status and controls
   - Real-time sync status indicators
   - Premium feature gating

7. **Subscription Store Updates**
   - Remote change notification handling
   - CloudKit sync event notifications
   - Data consistency maintenance

## Testing Checklist

### Prerequisites
- [ ] Apple Developer Account with paid membership
- [ ] CloudKit container configured in Apple Developer Console
- [ ] Multiple test devices with different iCloud accounts
- [ ] Premium subscription testing capability

### Phase 1: Basic Setup Testing
- [ ] App builds successfully with CloudKit entitlements
- [ ] CloudKit container initializes without errors
- [ ] Core Data dual-store setup works correctly
- [ ] App functions normally for non-premium users

### Phase 2: Account Status Testing
- [ ] Test with no iCloud account signed in
- [ ] Test with iCloud account signed in
- [ ] Test with iCloud disabled for app
- [ ] Test with managed/restricted iCloud accounts
- [ ] Verify account status updates correctly

### Phase 3: Sync Functionality Testing
- [ ] Enable iCloud sync as premium user
- [ ] Create subscriptions on Device A
- [ ] Verify data appears on Device B
- [ ] Modify data on Device B
- [ ] Verify changes sync back to Device A
- [ ] Test real-time sync during app usage

### Phase 4: Premium Feature Gating
- [ ] Non-premium users see "upgrade required" message
- [ ] Premium users can enable/disable sync
- [ ] Sync automatically disables when subscription expires
- [ ] UI updates correctly based on premium status

### Phase 5: Error Handling Testing
- [ ] Turn off Wi-Fi/cellular during sync
- [ ] Test with iCloud storage full
- [ ] Sign out of iCloud during active sync
- [ ] Test CloudKit service outages (simulate)
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Test recovery actions (Settings, retry, etc.)

### Phase 6: Edge Cases
- [ ] Delete app and reinstall (data should sync back)
- [ ] Factory reset one device (data should re-download)
- [ ] Test with large amounts of subscription data
- [ ] Simultaneous edits on multiple devices
- [ ] Network interruption during sync

### Phase 7: Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure app launch time with CloudKit enabled
- [ ] Test sync performance with varying data sizes
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during sync operations
- [ ] Verify UI responsiveness during background sync

## Configuration Steps for Testing

### 1. Apple Developer Console Setup
1. Sign in to Apple Developer Console
2. Go to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"
3. Select your App ID (com.kansyl.app)
4. Enable CloudKit capability
5. Configure CloudKit container: `iCloud.com.kansyl.app`

### 2. Xcode Project Configuration
1. Select target in Xcode
2. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
3. Add CloudKit capability
4. Verify container identifier matches
5. Ensure development team is set

### 3. Testing Environment Setup
1. Create CloudKit development schema
2. Use different iCloud accounts for testing
3. Test on both simulator and real devices
4. Enable CloudKit Console for monitoring

## Premium Feature Integration

The CloudKit sync is implemented as a premium-only feature:

### Current Implementation
- Premium status checked via `UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "isPremiumUser")`
- **TODO**: Connect to actual subscription manager
- Non-premium users see upgrade prompts

### Integration Points
```swift
// In CloudKitManager.swift - Line 60-64
var isPremiumUser: Bool {
    // TODO: Connect to your premium subscription manager
    // For now, we'll check UserDefaults as a placeholder
    return UserDefaults.standard.bool(forKey: "isPremiumUser")
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### CloudKit Console
- Monitor sync operations
- View record types and data
- Debug sync conflicts
- Check quota usage

### Xcode Console Logging
- Core Data CloudKit logging enabled
- Custom sync status logging
- Error tracking and reporting

### User Feedback Integration
- Sync status visible in UI
- Last sync timestamp displayed
- Clear error messages with recovery options

## Production Considerations

### Security
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- User data isolated by Apple ID
- No sensitive data stored (only subscription names, dates, notes)

### Privacy
- Users control their iCloud sync preference
- Data stays within user's iCloud account
- No cross-user data sharing

### Reliability
- Automatic retry on transient errors
- Graceful degradation when CloudKit unavailable
- Local data always available as fallback

## Known Limitations

1. **Initial Setup**: Requires manual container configuration in Apple Developer Console
2. **Testing**: CloudKit development/production environments are separate
3. **Premium Dependency**: Currently uses placeholder premium check
4. **Network Dependency**: Requires internet connection for sync

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Premium Integration**: Connect CloudKitManager to actual subscription system
2. **Production Testing**: Test with production CloudKit environment
3. **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune sync frequency and batch operations
4. **User Onboarding**: Add guided setup for iCloud sync
5. **Analytics**: Track sync usage and error rates

## Support Information

### Common User Issues
1. **"iCloud Sign-In Required"** → Guide user to Settings
2. **"Network Connection Required"** → Check WiFi/cellular
3. **"iCloud Storage Full"** → Suggest storage upgrade
4. **"Premium Feature"** → Prompt to upgrade subscription
