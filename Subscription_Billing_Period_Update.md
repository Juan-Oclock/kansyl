# Subscription Billing Period Update

## Changes Made
Updated the receipt scanning feature to properly handle billing periods and dates from receipts.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Preserve Original Billing Period**
- No longer converts all prices to monthly
- Keeps the actual billing period (Quarterly = 90 days, Yearly = 365 days, etc.)
- Shows the correct price per period in the confirmation dialog

### 2. **Use Actual Receipt Date**
- Uses the date from the receipt as the subscription start date
- If receipt shows "July 31, 2025", that becomes the start date
- Falls back to today's date only if no date is found on receipt

### 3. **Enhanced Date Parsing**
Supports multiple date formats:
- `Jul 31, 2025`
- `MM/dd/yyyy`
- `yyyy-MM-dd`
- `MMMM dd, yyyy`
- And many more formats

### 4. **Improved Confirmation Display**
Shows complete information:
- Service name
- Original price with correct period (e.g., "$45.00/quarter")
- Billing cycle type
- Start date from receipt

### 5. **Smart Storage**
- Stores subscriptions with correct period lengths
- Internally calculates monthly price for budget tracking
- Preserves original billing information in notes

## Example: Mobbin Pro Quarterly Subscription

## Testing
1. Scan a receipt with subscription info
2. Verify:
   - Correct billing period displayed (not always "/month")
   - Start date matches receipt date
   - End date calculated based on billing period
   - Price shown as on receipt (not converted)

## Benefits
- **Accurate Tracking**: Subscriptions match actual billing cycles
- **Correct Dates**: Uses real receipt dates, not today's date
- **Clear Display**: Shows actual price per period, not converted amounts
- **Better Budgeting**: Still calculates monthly cost internally for budget reports
