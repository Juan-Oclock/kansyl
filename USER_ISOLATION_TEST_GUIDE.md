## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Created `UserSpecificPreferences` class for user isolation
- Updated `AuthenticationWrapperView` to use user preferences
- Updated `ContentView` to use user preferences
- Updated `OnboardingView` to use user preferences
- Created migration helper `AppPreferencesMigration`
- Subscription data already filtered by userID

### ‚ö†Ô∏è In Progress
- Migrating all views from `AppPreferences.shared` to `UserSpecificPreferences`
- Testing all isolation scenarios

### üìù Notes
- All preferences are now stored with user-specific keys (e.g., `user_12345_theme`)
- When a user logs out, preferences reset to defaults
- When a user logs back in, their preferences are restored
- The system maintains backward compatibility during migration
