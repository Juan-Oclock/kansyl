### Version 2 - Story-Driven (Alternative)

```
Remember that streaming service free trial you forgot to cancel? The $15.99 charge that hit your card before you even watched a single show? We've all been there.

Kansyl is your personal free trial assistant - designed to save you money and eliminate subscription anxiety.

THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

Free trials are great... until they're not. Companies make canceling hard on purpose. They count on you forgetting. They hide cancel buttons. They charge you before you realize what happened.

Not anymore.

THE KANSYL DIFFERENCE

‚ö° Add Trials in Seconds
No complex setup. Choose from templates for Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, Adobe, and hundreds more. Or create custom trials for any service.

üéØ Reminders That Actually Help
3 days before: "Your Netflix trial ends soon. Time to decide."
1 day before: "Final reminder - Netflix trial expires tomorrow."
Day of: "Last chance! Your Netflix trial ends today."

Take action right from the notification. No need to open the app.

üíµ Watch Your Savings Grow
Every canceled trial adds to your savings counter. See exactly how much money Kansyl has saved you. It's surprisingly motivating.

üîê Your Privacy Matters
Most apps want your email, your data, your attention. Kansyl is different:
‚Ä¢ No account required (unless you want iCloud sync)
‚Ä¢ All data stored locally on your device
‚Ä¢ No tracking or analytics without permission
‚Ä¢ No selling your information, ever
‚Ä¢ Open about what we collect (spoiler: almost nothing)

üöÄ Features That Make Life Easier

Smart Reminders: Get notified at the perfect time
AI Receipt Scanner: Photo ‚Üí Trial details (like magic)
Siri Integration: "Hey Siri, add my HBO Max trial"
Widgets: See upcoming trials on your home screen
Calendar Sync: Export trials to Apple Calendar
Share Extension: Save trials from any app
Export Data: Your data, your control
Trial History: Never lose track of past subscriptions

START FREE, UPGRADE IF YOU LOVE IT

Free Forever Tier:
‚Ä¢ Track up to 5 trials
‚Ä¢ Smart reminders
‚Ä¢ Full history
‚Ä¢ No credit card needed

Premium (When You Need More):
‚Ä¢ Unlimited trial tracking
‚Ä¢ AI receipt scanning
