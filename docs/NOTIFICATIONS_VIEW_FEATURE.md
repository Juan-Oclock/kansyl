# Notifications View Feature

## Overview
This document describes the new Notifications View feature that allows users to view, manage, and clear app notifications directly within the app.

## Problem Statement
Previously, users had no way to:
- View notifications that were delivered to the app
- See what notifications are scheduled to be sent
- Clear the notification badge from within the app
- Manage individual notifications

The only way to clear the badge was through iOS Settings or by interacting with each notification as it arrived.

## Solution

### New NotificationsView Component
**File**: `kansyl/Views/NotificationsView.swift`

A dedicated view for managing all notification activity, featuring:

#### 1. **Delivered Notifications Section ("Recent")**
- Shows all notifications that have been delivered
- Displays title, body, and relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
- Individual dismiss button for each notification
- Automatically updates the app badge count when dismissed

#### 2. **Pending Notifications Section ("Scheduled")**  
- Shows all notifications scheduled to be sent in the future
- Displays scheduled date and time
- Option to cancel individual pending notifications
- Useful for seeing what reminders are coming up

#### 3. **Empty State**
- Clean, friendly message when no notifications exist
- "You're all caught up!" message
- Bell slash icon for visual clarity

#### 4. **Clear All Functionality**
- "Clear All" button in navigation bar (when notifications exist)
- Confirmation alert before clearing
- Removes all delivered notifications
- Resets app badge to 0
- Provides haptic feedback

### Integration with SettingsView
**File**: `kansyl/Views/SettingsView.swift`

Added new "View Notifications" button in the Notifications section:
- Located above "Notification Settings"
- Shows "Manage delivered and scheduled" subtitle
- Opens NotificationsView as a sheet

## Features

### Notification Cards

#### Delivered Notification Card
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🔔  Trial Ending Soon              × │
│     Your Spotify trial ends in 3 days│
│     2 hours ago                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Pending Notification Card
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⏰  Trial Reminder                 × │
│     Your Netflix trial ends tomorrow │
│     📅 Jan 15, 2025 at 9:00 AM      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Badge Management
- **View notifications**: Badge count shown on app icon
- **Dismiss individual**: Badge decreases by 1
- **Clear all**: Badge resets to 0
- **Auto-update**: Badge syncs with delivered notifications

### User Experience

#### Navigation Flow
```

    ↓
NotificationsView opens as sheet

#### Haptic Feedback
- ✅ **Success**: When clearing all notifications

## Technical Implementation

### APIs Used

    // Process requests
}

// Remove all delivered notifications
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().removeAllDeliveredNotifications()

// Remove specific notification
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().removeDeliveredNotifications(withIdentifiers: [id])

// Clear badge
UIApplication.shared.applicationIconBadgeNumber = 0
```

### State Management
- `@State private var deliveredNotifications: [UNNotification]`
- `@State private var pendingNotifications: [UNNotificationRequest]`
