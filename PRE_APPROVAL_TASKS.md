## üéØ Priority Tasks (Do These First)

### 1. Write App Store Description & Marketing Copy ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Why Now**: This takes time and iteration. Get it polished before submission.

#### App Description (4000 char max)
Draft a compelling description covering:
- **Opening hook**: The pain point (forgotten free trials = wasted money)
- **Key features**:
  - Lightning-fast trial entry with templates
  - Smart 3-day, 1-day, and day-of reminders
  - Savings tracking and analytics
  - Privacy-first local storage (no data selling)
  - Siri Shortcuts integration
  - AI receipt scanning
  - iCloud sync, widgets, share extension
- **Benefits**: Save money, avoid unwanted charges, build better habits
- **Call to action**: "Download free, track up to 5 trials. Upgrade when you're ready."

**Action**: Create `APP_STORE_COPY.md` with full description

#### Keywords (100 char max, comma-separated)
Research and select from:
- `free trial,subscription,reminder,tracker,trials,money,savings,notifications,cancel,budgeting,expense`

**Action**: Test different combinations, prioritize high-volume low-competition terms

#### Promotional Text (170 char, updateable anytime)
Example: "Track unlimited free trials, get smart reminders before charges hit. Join users who never miss a trial deadline. Start free!"

#### Release Notes (What's New)
For v1.0: "Initial release! Track your free trials, get timely reminders, and never get charged unexpectedly again. Features include AI receipt scanning, Siri Shortcuts, iCloud sync, and more."

- **6.5" Display** (iPhone 11 Pro Max): 1242 x 2688 px
- **5.5" Display** (iPhone 8 Plus): 1242 x 2208 px

2. **Add trial**: Show quick entry flow with templates
3. **Notifications**: Display reminder notifications with actions
4. **Savings**: Analytics/savings dashboard
5. **AI Scanning**: Receipt scanning in action
6. **Features**: Settings or features overview (Siri, widgets, etc.)

5. **25-30s**: Call to action - "Download free today"

#### Production Tips
