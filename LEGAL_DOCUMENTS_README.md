# Legal Documents - Hosting Instructions

**Created:** September 30, 2025

## üìÑ Documents Created

Three essential legal documents have been created for your Kansyl app:

2. **`TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md`** - Recommended (protects you legally)
3. **`DATA_COLLECTION_SUMMARY.md`** - Reference for App Store Connect privacy questionnaire

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Hosting Requirements

### Apple Requires:
- **Privacy Policy URL must be publicly accessible**

**You CANNOT submit to App Store without a hosted Privacy Policy URL!**
