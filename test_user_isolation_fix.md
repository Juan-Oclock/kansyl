# History Page User Isolation Fix Test

## What Was Fixed
The `HistoryView` was using a `@FetchRequest` that fetched ALL past subscriptions from the database without filtering by user ID. This caused subscription history to leak between different user accounts.

## Changes Made
1. **Replaced `@FetchRequest`**: Removed the static `@FetchRequest` that fetched all subscriptions regardless of user
2. **Used SubscriptionStore filtered data**: Changed to use `subscriptionStore.allSubscriptions` which is already filtered by the current user's ID
3. **Updated filtering logic**: Modified `filteredSubscriptions` and `countForFilter` to work with user-filtered data

## Test Steps

### Setup
1. Ensure you have at least 2 test user accounts:
   - User A: test1@example.com
   - User B: test2@example.com

### Test Scenario
1. **Login as User A**
   - Add a few subscriptions (e.g., Netflix, Spotify)
   - Cancel or mark some as "Kept" so they appear in History
   - Note what subscriptions appear in the History tab
   - **Logout**

2. **Login as User B**  
   - Go to the History tab
   - **Expected Result**: Should see NO subscriptions from User A
   - Add different subscriptions for User B
   - Cancel some subscriptions for User B
   - Note what appears in User B's History

3. **Switch back to User A**
   - Login as User A again
   - Go to History tab
   - **Expected Result**: Should only see User A's subscription history, NOT User B's

### What Should Work Now
- ✅ History is properly isolated between users
- ✅ Filter counts (All, Saved, Kept, Expired) show correct numbers per user
- ✅ Search within history only searches current user's subscriptions
- ✅ Month groupings only show current user's subscription history

### Known Remaining Issue
The KansylWidget still has user isolation issues and will show all users' data. This requires a separate fix.

## Technical Details
The fix works because:
1. `SubscriptionStore.allSubscriptions` is already filtered by `currentUserID` via the `fetchSubscriptions()` method
2. When users switch accounts, `AuthenticationWrapperView` calls `SubscriptionStore.shared.updateCurrentUser()` 
3. This triggers a new fetch that only gets subscriptions for the current user
4. The History view now uses this filtered data instead of querying the database directly
