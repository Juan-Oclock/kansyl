# DeepSeek API JSON Parsing Fix

## Problem
The AI receipt scanning feature was failing with JSON parsing errors when processing DeepSeek API responses. The errors occurred because:
1. DeepSeek sometimes wraps JSON responses in markdown code blocks
2. Response format variations between different API calls
3. Inconsistent key naming conventions in the response
4. Amount values returned as strings with currency symbols

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
Added detailed logging throughout the parsing chain to identify where failures occur:
- Raw API response logging
- Content extraction logging  
- JSON parsing status updates
- Detailed error messages with actual content that failed to parse

### 2. Response Cleaning
Implemented content cleaning to handle markdown-wrapped JSON:
```swift
let cleanedContent = content
    .replacingOccurrences(of: "```json", with: "")
    .replacingOccurrences(of: "```", with: "")
    .trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
```

### 3. Flexible JSON Structure Handling
Updated `parseReceiptDataFromJSON` to handle both nested and flat JSON structures:
```swift
// Handle both nested and flat JSON structures from DeepSeek
let receiptData: [String: Any]
if let nestedData = json["receipt_data"] as? [String: Any] {
    receiptData = nestedData
} else {
    receiptData = json
}
```

### 4. Multiple Key Variation Support
Added fallback key checking for common variations:
```swift
// Try multiple key variations for each field
data.serviceName = (receiptData["serviceName"] as? String) ??
                  (receiptData["service_name"] as? String) ??
                  (receiptData["name"] as? String)

data.subscriptionType = (receiptData["subscriptionType"] as? String) ??
                       (receiptData["subscription_type"] as? String) ??
                       (receiptData["billing_cycle"] as? String)
```

### 5. Robust Amount Parsing
Enhanced amount parsing to handle multiple formats:
```swift
// Handle amount parsing with string or number formats
if let amountString = receiptData["amount"] as? String {
    // Remove currency symbols and commas
    let cleanAmount = amountString
        .replacingOccurrences(of: "$", with: "")
        .replacingOccurrences(of: ",", with: "")
        .trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespaces)
    data.amount = Double(cleanAmount)
} else if let amountNumber = receiptData["amount"] as? Double {
    data.amount = amountNumber
} else if let amountInt = receiptData["amount"] as? Int {
    data.amount = Double(amountInt)
}
```

## Files Modified
- `/kansyl/Utilities/ReceiptScanner.swift`
  - Fixed duplicate return statement bug
  - Enhanced API response parsing with better error handling
  - Added flexible JSON structure support
  - Improved amount parsing logic

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various receipt types (digital, physical photos)
2. Verify parsing handles different amount formats ($10.99, 10.99, "10.99", etc.)
3. Test with receipts containing multiple subscriptions
4. Verify error messages are helpful when parsing fails
5. Monitor console logs during scanning to identify any remaining issues

## Expected Behavior
- The app should now successfully parse DeepSeek API responses
- Markdown-wrapped JSON responses are handled gracefully
- Different key naming conventions are supported
- Amount values with currency symbols are parsed correctly
- Detailed error messages help diagnose any remaining issues

## Next Steps if Issues Persist
1. Check console logs for the actual DeepSeek response format
2. Add more key variations if new formats are discovered
3. Consider implementing a fallback to extract basic info if structured parsing fails
4. Add response validation to ensure required fields are present before processing
