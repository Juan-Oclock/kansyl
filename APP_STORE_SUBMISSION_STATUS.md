## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES TO FIX

### Screenshot Issues
1. **File naming inconsistency** in 6.7-inch folder:
   - File: `3-Detail-iPhone16ProMax.png.png` (has double .png extension)
   - Should be: `03-Detail-iPhone16ProMax.png`
   
2. **Resolution mismatch**:
   - Current: 1320 x 2868 pixels
   - Apple requires: 1290 x 2796 pixels (6.7-inch display)
   - Current: 1179 x 2556 pixels  
   - Apple requires: 1242 x 2688 pixels (6.5-inch display)
   
   **Action needed**: Screenshots need to be resized to match Apple's exact requirements

### URL Issues in Metadata
- Support URL in metadata: `https://kansyl.app/support` (doesn't exist)
- Marketing URL in metadata: `https://kansyl.app` (doesn't exist)
- Actual working URLs: `https://kansyl.juan-oclock.com/*`

**Action needed**: Update AppStoreMetadata.md with correct URLs
