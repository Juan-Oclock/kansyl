## 📝 Important Notes

### StoreKit Behavior
- App defaults to **free tier (5 subscriptions)** if not signed into App Store
- This is **expected behavior** and won't affect production users
- Users who purchase premium will have entitlements checked properly

### CloudKit for Future
When you want to enable CloudKit sync (v2.0):
1. Uncomment CloudKit entitlement in `kansyl.entitlements`
2. Change `NSPersistentContainer` back to `NSPersistentCloudKitContainer`
3. Enable `setupCloudKitStores()` call
4. Test thoroughly before release

### Apple Developer Portal
Make sure you've completed:
- [x] Created Services ID: `com.juan-oclock.kansyl.signin`
- [x] Associated with App ID
- [x] Added Supabase callback URL
- [x] Created Sign in with Apple key
- [x] Configured Supabase with credentials

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** on real device
2. **Submit to App Store** when ready
3. **Monitor analytics** for auth method adoption
4. **Plan CloudKit** for future premium feature

**All systems GO! 🚀**
