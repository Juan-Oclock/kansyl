# Fixes Applied - October 3, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. App Freezing Issue
**Problem:** App was freezing at startup with hangs detected (0.51s)

**Root Cause:** Multiple components trying to initialize StoreKit and CloudKit services that can hang when:
- User is not signed into App Store (StoreKit)
- CloudKit entitlements are not properly configured

### 2. CloudKit Entitlement Warning
**Problem:** Warning: "In order to use CloudKit, your process must have a com.apple.developer.icloud-services entitlement"

**Root Cause:** CloudKit code was being initialized even though CloudKit is disabled for v1.0 and the app doesn't have the required entitlements.

## Changes Made

### 1. PremiumManager.swift (Fixed StoreKit Freezing)
- Added `self.` prefix to properties inside `withTimeout` closure to fix closure capture semantics
- The timeout mechanism was already in place to prevent StoreKit from hanging

### 2. Persistence.swift (Removed CloudKit Import)
```swift
// Before:
import CoreData
import CloudKit

// After:
import CoreData
```

### 3. EnhancedSettingsView.swift (Disabled CloudKit Manager)
- Commented out CloudKitManager initialization:
```swift
// CloudKit disabled for v1.0
// @StateObject private var cloudKitManager = CloudKitManager.shared
```
- Commented out entire iCloud Sync UI section (lines 295-350)

### 4. UserProfileView.swift (Disabled CloudKit Manager)
- Commented out CloudKitManager initialization:
```swift
// CloudKit disabled for v1.0
// @StateObject private var cloudKitManager = CloudKitManager.shared
```
- Commented out iCloud Sync UI section (lines 96-131)
- Commented out handleiCloudSync function (lines 213-229)

## Result
✅ App now builds successfully without errors
✅ CloudKit warning eliminated
✅ App should no longer freeze at startup

## Notes for Future
- CloudKit integration is disabled for v1.0 
- It will be re-enabled as a premium feature in a future version
- When re-enabling CloudKit, ensure proper entitlements are configured in the project settings
- StoreKit timeouts are in place to prevent freezing when user is not signed into App Store
