**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30  
**App Version**: Pre-Release Audit  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive security review before App Store submission

---

## 1. API Keys and Secrets Management

### Configuration Files
- [ ] Verify `Config.xcconfig` exists and is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Verify `Config.plist` exists and is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Verify `APIConfig.swift` exists and is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Check that template files (`Config-Template.xcconfig`, etc.) are committed
- [ ] Ensure no actual API keys exist in template files

### Git History Audit
- [ ] Search git history for exposed secrets: `git log -p | grep -i "sk-"`
- [ ] Search for DeepSeek keys: `git log -p | grep -i "deepseek"`
- [ ] Search for Supabase credentials: `git log -p | grep -i "supabase"`
- [ ] Use tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog` for comprehensive scanning
- [ ] If secrets found, rotate all compromised keys immediately

### Code Review
- [ ] Grep codebase for hardcoded API keys: `grep -r "sk-" kansyl/`
- [ ] Search for hardcoded URLs with credentials
- [ ] Verify all API keys loaded from external config, not hardcoded
- [ ] Check Share Extension for proper credential handling
- [ ] Check Widget Extension for proper credential handling

### Best Practices
- [ ] API keys loaded at runtime from `Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey:)`
- [ ] Fallback error messages don't expose key structure
- [ ] Development vs Production keys properly separated
- [ ] Document rotation procedure in SECURITY.md
