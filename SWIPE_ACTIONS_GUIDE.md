# Swipe Actions Feature Guide

## ✨ Feature Overview
The subscription cards now support swipe-to-action gestures, allowing users to quickly manage their subscriptions with intuitive swipe gestures.

## 🎯 How It Works

### Swipe Left on Any Subscription Card
When you swipe left on a subscription card, two action buttons are revealed:

1. **Keep Button (Purple)** 
   - Icon: ✓ (checkmark.circle.fill)
   - Action: Marks the subscription as "Kept"
   - Use: When you decide to continue with the subscription after the trial

2. **Cancel Button (Green)**
   - Icon: ✗ (xmark.circle.fill)  
   - Action: Marks the subscription as "Canceled"
   - Use: When you successfully cancel the subscription before charges

## 📱 User Experience

### Visual Feedback
- **Smooth Animation**: The card slides smoothly to reveal actions
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Purple for "Keep" (continuing the subscription)
  - Green for "Cancel" (saving money!)
- **Haptic Feedback**: Gentle vibration confirms the action

### Swipe Behavior
- **Threshold**: Swipe left past 80 pixels to reveal actions
- **Snap Points**: Card automatically snaps to show actions or reset
- **Reset**: Swipe right or tap elsewhere to hide actions

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Components Modified
1. **SubscriptionRowCard**: Enhanced with swipe gesture recognition
2. **SubscriptionStore**: Handles status updates (canceled/kept)
3. **Analytics**: Tracks user actions for insights

### Status Flow
```
Active Subscription
    ├── Swipe Left → Cancel → Status: "Canceled" (Saved money!)
    └── Swipe Left → Keep → Status: "Kept" (Continuing subscription)
```

## 📊 Benefits

1. **Quick Actions**: No need to open detail views
2. **Visual Confirmation**: Immediate status update
3. **Undo Support**: Can change status later if needed
4. **Analytics Tracking**: Helps track savings and decisions

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Intuitive**: Follows iOS standard swipe patterns
- **Non-Destructive**: Actions can be reversed
- **Accessible**: Clear visual indicators
- **Responsive**: Smooth 60fps animations

## 💡 Tips for Users

1. **Quick Decision**: Swipe left when you receive cancellation confirmation
2. **Track Savings**: Canceled subscriptions contribute to your savings
3. **Review History**: Check the History tab to see past decisions
4. **Bulk Actions**: For multiple subscriptions, use bulk management

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If swipe actions aren't working:
1. Ensure you're swiping left (not right)
2. Swipe with sufficient distance (> 80 pixels)
3. Check that the subscription is in "Active" status
4. Restart the app if gestures are unresponsive
