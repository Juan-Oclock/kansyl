# Quick Actions Implementation Guide

## Overview
We've implemented an enhanced quick actions system for subscription cards that provides multiple interaction patterns based on urgency and user preference.

## Components

### 1. SubscriptionCardSelector
**Location:** `Views/SubscriptionCardSelector.swift`

The main component that intelligently selects which card style to display based on:
- User preference (stored in UserDefaults)
- Subscription urgency (days remaining)
- iOS version compatibility

### 2. Card Implementations

#### EnhancedSubscriptionCard (Inline Actions)
**Location:** `Views/EnhancedSubscriptionCard.swift`
- **Best for:** Urgent subscriptions (≤3 days remaining)
- **Features:**
  - Visible Keep/Cancel buttons for quick decisions
  - Status badges show decision made
  - Urgent banner for subscriptions ending today/tomorrow
  - Visual urgency indicators (colored dots)

#### ContextMenuSubscriptionCard (Long Press Menu)
**Location:** `Views/ContextMenuSubscriptionCard.swift`
- **Best for:** Moderate urgency (4-7 days remaining)
- **Features:**
  - Long press reveals context menu
  - Direct cancellation links to service websites
  - "Remind me later" option (snooze)
  - Clean interface until interaction

#### HybridSubscriptionCard (Enhanced Swipe)
**Location:** `Views/HybridSubscriptionCard.swift`
- **Best for:** Users who prefer swipe gestures
- **Features:**
  - Visual swipe hints for first-time users
  - Progressive reveal of action icons
  - Confirmation dialog for actions
  - Tutorial toast for new users

### 3. Settings Integration
**Location:** `Views/SettingsView.swift` + `CardStyleSettingsView`

Users can choose their preferred interaction style:
- **Smart** (default): Adaptive based on urgency
- **Inline**: Always show action buttons
- **Swipe**: Always use swipe gestures
- **Menu**: Always use context menu

## Usage

### Basic Integration
```swift
// Replace SubscriptionRowCard with SubscriptionCardSelector
SubscriptionCardSelector(
    subscription: subscription,
    subscriptionStore: subscriptionStore,
    action: { 
        // Handle tap to view details
        selectedSubscription = subscription 
    }
)
```

### Smart Selection Logic
The default "Smart" mode uses this logic:
- **≤3 days remaining**: Inline action buttons (most urgent)
- **4-7 days remaining**: Context menu (moderate urgency)
- **>7 days remaining**: Standard card with swipe

## Cancellation URLs

The context menu includes direct links to cancellation pages for popular services:

- Netflix: `https://www.netflix.com/cancelplan`
- Spotify: `https://www.spotify.com/account/subscription/`
- Disney+: `https://www.disneyplus.com/account/subscription`
- Amazon Prime: `https://www.amazon.com/gp/primecentral`
- Apple TV+: `https://tv.apple.com/settings/subscriptions`
- Hulu: `https://secure.hulu.com/account`
- HBO Max: `https://play.hbomax.com/settings/subscription`

## iOS Compatibility

All components are compatible with **iOS 15.0+**:
- No use of iOS 17+ APIs (sensoryFeedback, Observable, etc.)
- Fallback implementations for older iOS versions
- Proper availability checks where needed

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- ✅ Haptic feedback on actions (using HapticManager)
- ✅ Color-coded urgency indicators
- ✅ Status badges after decision
- ✅ Spring animations for delightful interactions

### Discoverability
- 🎯 Progressive disclosure based on urgency
- 💡 Visual hints for swipe gestures
- 📝 First-time user tutorials
- ⚙️ User preference settings

### Confirmation & Undo
- Action confirmations for destructive operations
- Toast notifications with undo capability (to be implemented)
- Clear visual feedback when action is taken

## Future Enhancements

1. **Toast System**: Implement global toast notifications with undo
2. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple subscriptions for batch operations
3. **Smart Reminders**: AI-powered reminder timing based on user behavior
4. **More Service URLs**: Expand cancellation URL database
5. **Analytics**: Track which interaction style users prefer

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test all card styles with different urgency levels
- [ ] Verify swipe gestures don't interfere with scroll
- [ ] Check context menu on different device sizes
- [ ] Confirm haptic feedback works on all devices
- [ ] Test dark mode appearance
- [ ] Verify iOS 15 compatibility
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver for accessibility

## Troubleshooting

### Swipe Not Working
- Check minimum swipe distance (set to 20pt)
- Verify horizontal movement > vertical (1.5x ratio)
- Ensure no gesture conflicts with parent ScrollView

### Context Menu Not Appearing
- Long press duration may need adjustment
- Check if view has other gesture recognizers

### Performance Issues
- Reduce animation complexity for older devices
- Consider lazy loading for large subscription lists
