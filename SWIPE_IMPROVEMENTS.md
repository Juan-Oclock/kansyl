# Swipe Actions UI Improvements ‚ú®

## üé® Design System Integration
All UI components now follow your established design system from `DesignSystem.swift` and `style-guide.md`.

## üÜï Key Improvements

### 1. **Smooth Fade Effect for Price** üìä
- The price amount (`$X.XX/mo`) now **gradually fades out** as you swipe left
- Prevents visual overlap with action buttons
- Uses calculated opacity: `1 - (swipeProgress * 1.2)` for faster fade
- Smooth animation using `Design.Animation.smooth`

### 2. **Progressive Action Button Reveal** üéØ
- Action buttons **fade in progressively** as you swipe
- Scale effect: buttons start at 80% size and grow to 100%
- Opacity increases from 0 to 1 based on swipe distance
- Creates a delightful "reveal" effect

### 3. **Enhanced Visual Feedback** üí´
- **Elastic resistance** when swiping past the threshold
- **Haptic feedback** when reaching action point (light tap)
- **Immediate haptic** on button press (success vibration)
- **Smooth spring animations** for all transitions

### 4. **Design System Colors** üé®
Following your style guide:
- **Keep Button**: Uses `Design.Colors.kept` (blue gradient)
- **Cancel Button**: Uses `Design.Colors.success` (green gradient)
- **Text Colors**: Proper hierarchy with primary/secondary
- **Urgency Colors**: 
  - Red (`danger`) for ‚â§3 days
  - Yellow (`warning`) for ‚â§5 days
  - Gray (`textSecondary`) for normal

### 5. **Improved Typography** üìù
- Subscription name: `Design.Typography.callout(.semibold)`
- Days remaining: `Design.Typography.footnote()`
- Price: `Design.Typography.callout(.semibold)` 
- Monthly label: `Design.Typography.caption()`
- Action labels: `Design.Typography.caption(.medium)`

### 6. **Better Interaction Mechanics** üîÑ
- **Swipe threshold**: 80px to trigger actions
- **Maximum swipe**: Limited to 180px with elastic resistance
- **Snap points**: Automatically snaps to open (160px) or closed (0px)
- **Bidirectional**: Can swipe right to close when actions are showing

### 7. **Visual Polish** ‚ú®
- Gradient backgrounds on action buttons
- Consistent shadows using `Design.Shadow.sm`
- Proper corner radius using `Design.Radius.md`
- Smooth animations with `Design.Animation.spring`

## üì± User Experience Flow

1. **Initial State**: Card shows full content with price visible
2. **Start Swipe**: Price begins to fade, buttons start appearing
3. **Mid Swipe**: Price nearly invisible, buttons growing in
4. **Full Swipe**: Price hidden, action buttons fully visible
5. **Action Tap**: Haptic feedback + smooth reset animation

## üîß Technical Details

### Opacity Calculations
```swift
// Price fades out faster than swipe
priceOpacity = max(0, 1 - (swipeProgress * 1.2))

// Buttons fade in progressively  
actionButtonsOpacity = min(1, swipeProgress * 1.5)
```

### Animation Timing
- Fade animations: 300ms ease-in-out
- Spring animations: 400ms with 0.75 damping
- Haptic timing: Immediate on threshold and action

## üéØ Result
The swipe actions now feel more premium and polished, with smooth transitions that follow iOS design patterns while maintaining your app's unique visual identity through the design system.
