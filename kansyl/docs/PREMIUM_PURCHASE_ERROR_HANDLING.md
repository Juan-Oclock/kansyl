# Premium Purchase Error Handling Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the premium purchase flow with proper error handling, user feedback, and development testing support. This ensures users understand what's happening when they tap "Upgrade to Premium" and provides clear feedback for all scenarios.

## Problem Statement
Previously, when users tapped "Upgrade to Premium", there was no visible feedback if:
- Products failed to load from App Store
- Purchase failed for any reason
- Network connection was unavailable
- User cancelled the purchase flow

This made it appear as if "the button does nothing" when issues occurred.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Error State Management
Added state variables to track errors:
```swift
@State private var showingError = false
@State private var errorMessage = ""
```

### 2. Pre-Purchase Validation
Before initiating purchase, check if products are loaded:
```swift
guard premiumManager.getMonthlyPrice() != nil || premiumManager.getYearlyPrice() != nil else {
    errorMessage = "Unable to load premium products. Please check your internet connection and try again."
    showingError = true
    return
}
```

### 3. Post-Purchase Feedback
Handle all purchase states with appropriate feedback:
- ✅ **Success**: Haptic feedback + dismiss modal
- ❌ **Failed**: Error haptic + show error alert
- ⏸️ **Cancelled**: Silent return (no error)
- ⏳ **Loading**: Show spinner

### 4. Error Alert Dialog
Added alert to show clear error messages:
```swift
.alert("Purchase Error", isPresented: $showingError) {
    Button("OK", role: .cancel) { }
} message: {
    Text(errorMessage)
}
```

### 5. Development Testing Helper
Added visible sandbox indicator in DEBUG mode:
```swift
#if DEBUG
Text("Testing in sandbox mode - use your Apple ID")
    .font(.system(size: 11))
    .foregroundColor(.orange)
#endif
```

3. Set up sandbox test users
4. Check network connection

### "Products not found"

1. Ensure products created in App Store Connect
2. Wait 24 hours after creating products
3. Verify product IDs are correct
