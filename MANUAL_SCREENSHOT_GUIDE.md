# üì∏ Manual Screenshot Capture Guide (Recommended)

Since automated UI testing can be tricky with authentication and real data, here's a **simpler, faster approach** to capture perfect App Store screenshots.

## üéØ Why Manual Capture?

- ‚úÖ **Faster setup** - No complex UI test configuration
- ‚úÖ **Real data** - Shows your actual app with real subscriptions
- ‚úÖ **Full control** - Adjust exactly what you want to show
- ‚úÖ **Better quality** - Ensures status bar, content are perfect
- ‚úÖ **No test bugs** - Avoids simulator/test runner issues

## üöÄ Quick Method (15-20 minutes total)

### Step 1: Prepare Simulator

```bash
# Open your app in the largest iPhone simulator (required for App Store)
open -a Simulator

# From Xcode, select iPhone 16 Pro Max
# Then: Product > Run (‚åòR)
```

Or use this command to open specific simulator:
```bash
open -a Simulator --args -CurrentDeviceUDID AE30E995-929E-4740-AF9E-42120E998F63
```

### Step 2: Set Up Perfect Status Bar

**Clean the status bar** for professional screenshots:

1. In Simulator menu: **Features > Toggle Status Bar**
2. Or use shortcuts: `‚åòK` shows ideal status bar (9:41, full battery, full signal)

### Step 3: Navigate and Capture

For each screen you want to capture:

1. **Navigate to the screen** in your app
2. **Press `‚åòS`** in Simulator (or File > Save Screen)

## üì± Device Sizes Needed

### Required for App Store:

1. **iPhone 6.7" (iPhone 16 Pro Max)**
   - Resolution: 1290 x 2796
   - Your simulator: `iPhone 16 Pro Max`
   - **This is the minimum required size**

2. **Optional but Recommended:**
   - iPhone 6.5" - Use iPhone 15 Pro if available
   - iPad - Use iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)

## üìÇ Where Simulator Screenshots Are Saved

By default, screenshots go to your Desktop:
```bash
~/Desktop/
```

**Organize them:**
```bash
# Create a proper folder structure
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/Kansyl-Screenshots/6.7-inch
mkdir -p ~/Desktop/Kansyl-Screenshots/iPad

# Move screenshots there
mv ~/Desktop/*iPhone-16-Pro-Max*.png ~/Desktop/Kansyl-Screenshots/6.7-inch/
```

## üé® Pro Tips for Better Screenshots

### 1. Add Demo Data

Before capturing, add 4-5 realistic subscriptions:
- Netflix, Spotify, Disney+, etc.
- Mix of trials and active subscriptions
- Some ending soon, some with time left
- Show real prices

### 2. Status Bar Best Practices

Apple's standard for screenshots:
- ‚úÖ Time: **9:41 AM** (Apple's signature time)
- ‚úÖ Battery: **Full** (100%)
- ‚úÖ Signal: **Full bars**
- ‚úÖ WiFi: **Connected**
- ‚úÖ Carrier: **No carrier name** (looks cleaner)

Use Simulator's status bar override: `‚åòK`

### 3. Content Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Show 3-5 subscriptions (not too empty, not too crowded)
- ‚úÖ Use recognizable service names
- ‚úÖ Show realistic prices ($9.99, $15.99, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Include variety (some ending soon, some not)
- ‚úÖ Show your savings number (make it impressive! $500+)

### 4. Consistent Appearance

- Take all screenshots in one session
- Same light/dark mode (recommend light mode)
- Same status bar state
- Same demo data throughout

## üîÑ For Multiple Device Sizes

If you need screenshots for multiple devices:

```bash
# 1. iPhone 16 Pro Max (6.7" - REQUIRED)
# Already done above

# 2. iPhone 15 Pro (6.1")
# Change simulator to iPhone 15 Pro
# Repeat the 6 screenshots

# 3. iPad Pro 13-inch
# Change simulator to iPad Pro 13-inch (M4)
# Repeat the 6 screenshots
```

**Time per device**: ~10-15 minutes
